# Warm Lead Bot

Project Description

Warm Lead Bot is an intelligent assistant designed to help businesses identify genuine leads from public platforms. It automatically analyzes posts and messages to determine whether they represent potential customers actively looking for tech services, such as web development, mobile apps, UI/UX design, or automation solutions.

The bot filters out posts that are irrelevant, such as users offering their own services, asking for academic help, or engaging in general discussions. By streamlining lead qualification, this tool saves time and improves the efficiency of sales and marketing teams.

Features

Automatically classify posts as "warm leads" or "irrelevant".

Supports multiple platforms (initially designed for public social and forum posts).

Lightweight, easy to deploy, and can be run locally or on cloud environments.

Simple integration with messaging systems or internal dashboards.

Provides structured data output for CRM or further analysis.

How It Works

Input Collection: The bot receives a text post from a public platform.

Text Analysis: The message is analyzed using NLP models to identify the intent and urgency.

Lead Classification: Posts are classified as either:

Warm Lead: Genuine interest in a tech service.

Not a Lead: Offers services, asks for school help, or general discussion.

Output: The result is logged and optionally sent to a dashboard or notification system.
