# Automation-Warm-Leads-Bot
Developed a Python-based automation tool to interact with Google Sheets for managing and tracking warm leads efficiently. The project uses the gspread library with a Google Service Account to securely connect to a Google Sheet, read existing data, append new entries, and update specific cells programmatically.

Key features include:

Secure authentication: Integrated Google Service Account with proper scopes to access and modify Google Sheets.

Automated data logging: Append new rows with timestamps for tracking activities and lead status.

Data retrieval: Ability to read all rows and search for specific entries within the sheet.

Update capability: Modify any cell programmatically to reflect status changes or corrections.

Real-world applicability: Streamlines the process of lead tracking and reporting, reducing manual errors and saving time for sales or operations teams.
