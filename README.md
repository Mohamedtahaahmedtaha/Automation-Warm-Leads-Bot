# Warm Lead Generation Bot

### Overview
This project implements a fully automated **AI-powered lead generation system** that scans Reddit job and freelance communities, identifies "warm leads" (users looking to hire or purchase tech services), and logs them into a Google Sheet while notifying via Telegram.

It is the **mandatory project (75%)** for the Sofindex AI Automation Engineer practical assessment.


### Core Functionality
- Scrapes recent posts from relevant Reddit subreddits.
- Uses an **AI model** (`gpt-4o-mini` via OpenRouter) to analyze each post.
- Classifies posts as *warm leads* based on hiring or buying intent.
- Saves qualified leads to **Google Sheets** with timestamp, subreddit, link, summary, and confidence score.
- Sends **Telegram alerts** for high-confidence leads.



### Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.10+
- **APIs:** Reddit (PullPush API), OpenRouter (LLM), Telegram Bot API, Google Sheets API
- **Libraries:**  
  `requests`, `json`, `time`, `logging`, `gspread`, `tqdm`, `google.oauth2`, `datetime`
